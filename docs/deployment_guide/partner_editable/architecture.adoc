.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
* An Application Load Balancer to route Cribl Stream user traffic to Cribl Stream instances in the public subnets.
* In the public subnets, Cribl Stream deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an Auto Scaling group.*
* Amazon S3 for two buckets: one for Cribl Stream test data and another for CloudTrail logs.
* CloudTrail to log API calls to Cribl instances to an S3 bucket and send logging notifications to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
* Amazon SQS to notify subscribers when logs are written to the CloudTrail S3 bucket.
* An AWS Lambda function to empty the CloudTrail data S3 bucket upon stack deletion.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide the following:
** Lambda function and CloudTrail access to the CloudTrail data S3 bucket.
** Cribl Stream instances access to the Cribl Stream test data S3 bucket. You can edit the Cribl Stream IAM policy after deployment to add other Cribl-supported data sources and destinations.

[.small]#* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with Cribl Stream, this Partner Solution deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Partner Solution to a production environment, consider using a private subnet.#
