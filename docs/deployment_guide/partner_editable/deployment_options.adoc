This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/9xD3e?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (ARM64) with CloudTrail]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/PmWdw?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (x86) with CloudTrail]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
